3. The new Web Application file should be created and appear in the file explorer panel.
4. Edit your new Web Application file, by double clicking on file **wikipedia.webapp** in the file explorer panel:

- the file should open as an empty web viewer, as a new tab in the Documents panel.

5. In the Inspector panel, for the Start URL property, type **https://www.wikipedia.org/**
6. Once you enter your URL (such as pressing Tab or Enter), you should see the Wikipedia home page rendered in the web view
