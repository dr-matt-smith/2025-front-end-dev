# Hello World (Python programming)

This use case example shows you how to create and run a simple Python script.

1. Create a new Celbridge project (or use an existing one).
2. Right-mouse click in the file explorer and choose to add a new Python file named **hello.py**:

- choose menu: **Add | Python Script (.py)**
- enter the file name as **hello.py**

3. The new Python script file should be created and appear in the file explorer panel.
4. Edit your new script, by double clicking on file **hello.py** in the file explorer panel:

- the file should open in the code editor in the Documents panel

5. Type the following simple Python **print** statement:

   > ```
   > print("hello world")
   > ```
   >
   > :::{note}
   > There is no need to click anything to **save** your edits - since Celbridge automatically saves your changes as you type
   > :::

6. Run your Python script. Do this by right-mouse clicking in the file explorer over file **hello.py**, and choose the **Run** option.

7. In the **Console** panel you should see the CLI comment **%run hello.py** followed by the text "hello world" printed out on the next line.
